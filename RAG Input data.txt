Active Directory has two forms of common security principals: user accounts. These accounts represent a physical entity that is a person. 
Active Directory groups may be organized in a hierarchy like a folder structure. 
Users are assigned to Active Directory groups.Users that are assigned to the Active Directory group are members of the group. Usually users with similar profile attributes of Organization, Department, Role are assigned to 
the same Active Directory Group. 
 
Users have profile attributes such as 
first name, Last Name, Organization, Department, Role, Manager Name and are assigned one or moe Groups. 
If a user has a manager i.e. a Manager Name that is not "None" then the user's manager will have additional group assignments. 
The significant profile attributes to determine Active Directory group assignment are
Organization, Department, Role and whether the user is a manager of other users.
